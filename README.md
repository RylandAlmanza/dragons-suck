Dragons Suck
============

Dragons Suck is a sandbox survival game set in a world full of dragons. Dragons of all shapes and sizes. Contrary to popular belief, there is not just one species of dragon. There are hundreds, all with unique sets of physical traits and abilities. Some are peaceful, plant-eating creatures. Others, not so much.

Humans do exist in this world, and you are one of them. Unfortunately there are not very many others of your kind, as some of the more aggressive dragons have a habit of destroying entire villages full of you guys.

In Dragons Suck you start out with nothing. First thing you'll probably want to do is find a nice cave for shelter. Once you have found this, you should go out and find some things that you can make weapons and tools out of. Don't drift too far away from your cave, though. You'll need somewhere to run to if you happen to encounter a large aggressive dragon. You're not completely safe in your cave, either. Large dragons are too big to get in there, and most likely won't waste the energy spewing fire through the entrance. However, the smaller ones can walk right in. So it might be a good idea to keep a dragon-bashing rock somewhere in your cave.

As scary as the outside, dragon-infested world is, you can't hide in your cave forever. Eventually you're going to need food. What do you eat? Dragons. It sounds crazy, but some small dragons can be easily killed, and making a fire to cook them over is trivial. The meat is actually pretty tasty, too. Spicy, though. The rest of the dragon can be used for other things too. A few dragon hides can be patched together to make some protective clothing. Dragon scales are very tough.

So, what's the goal of the game? How do you win? Well, nothing. And you can't. But that doesn't mean you can't have fun! You can do whatever you want! Adventure, hunt dragons, find other people, deck out your cave, steal and raise a baby dragon! Just have fun, and try not to die!
